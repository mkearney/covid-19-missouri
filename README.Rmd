# covid-19-missouri

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This repo is for collecting testing and case-tracking information about COVID-19
in the great state of Missouri. Currently, [this code](R/scrape.R) is used to 
scrape updates from [health.mo.gov](https://health.mo.gov).

## Data

Data are saved as CSV files with each row representing a new observation at the
state or county level:

+ [State-wide totals](data/mo-total.csv)
+ [Cases by county](data/mo-county.csv)

```{r}
## state totals daya
suppressMessages(readr::read_csv("data/mo-total.csv"))

## county data
suppressMessages(readr::read_csv("data/mo-county.csv"))
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
mo <- suppressMessages(readr::read_csv("data/mo-total.csv"))
library(ggplot2)
p <- ggplot(mo, aes(x = .timestamp, y = total_cases)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  ylim(0, NA) +
  labs(x = "Date", y = "Number of Cases",
    title = "COVID-19 in Missouri: Number of Reported Cases",
    subtitle = paste0("Data from Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services (health.mo.gov) as of ", format(Sys.Date(), "%B %d, %Y")),
    caption = dataviz::theme_mwk_caption_text()) +
  dataviz::theme_mwk() +
